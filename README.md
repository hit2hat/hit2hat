# Stepan Novozhilov [Hit2Hat]

**I'm a 23 y.o. full-stack dev & UI/UX designer from Yaroslavl, Russia.**

Right now I’m building stuff at my own IT company — [Aeternus Capital](https://github.com/aeternus-capital), focused on custom software development and outsourcing solutions.
We help businesses bring ideas to life with code.

I've been coding since I was a teen and now work with big players like **VK, Sber, Mail.ru, Delivery Club**, and others.
Started contributing to **VK at just 17** — you could say I grew up in the tech world 😄

Tech I love:
- 💻 **Languages:** TypeScript (Deno in my heart), JavaScript, Node.js, C++, C#, PHP  
- 🗄️ **Databases & Tools:** MongoDB, Redis, RabbitMQ  
- 🚀 Side projects: AlphaMusic, MGSL, Nimble, Studenfy (formerly YSTU.ID)

Also into UI/UX design and building cool stuff on the side.
Check out my repos for code experiments, open-source things, and personal tools.

You can reach me via [VK](https://vk.com/ops) or [Telegram](https://t.me/hit2hat).
Feel free to drop a message — I’m always open to new opportunities and collaborations.

Have fun with my open source projects below ❤️
